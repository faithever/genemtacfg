Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm.</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This program encodes text configuration files which contain
Configuration File Settings into binary configuration files, as
specified by the DOCSIS RFI 1.1 Specification, Appendix C.</p>
<p>It supports most DOCSIS 1.1 Configuration Settings. Not supported
(currently):</p>
<ul>
<li>Telephony Settings</li>
<li>Modem Capabilities</li>
<li>TFTP server timestamp</li>
<li>TFTP server provisioned modem address</li>
<li>SNMPv3 settings (partial support provided)</li>
</ul>
<p>See DOCSIS 2.0 Radio Frequency Interface Specification, Appendix C
for a description of these settings.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>More than one (up to 16) ClassOfService statements can appear in the
configuration file. Only one BaselinePrivacy (BPI) statement can
appear. The program does not check for the number of ClassOfService
statements that appear, you have to make sure not to include more than
16 or unexpected results will occur (modems /CMTSes may reset).</p>
<p>DOCSIS BPI Specification clearly states that the BPI settings MUST
NOT be present if Privacy is not enabled in [at least one of] the
ClassOfService parameters (for example if PrivacyEnable is 0 for all
classes of service, BPI statement should not appear).</p>
<p>The program is not yet as "intelligent" as to detect these problems
automatically.</p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>There are three modes of operation:</p>
<h2>Encoding CM configuration files</h2>
<p>To encode a CM configuration file, run:<br />
<code>$ docsis -e cm_config_file.cfg my_key_file
cm_config_file.bin</code></p>
<p>The format of the text configuration file is described <a href=
"config-format.html">here</a>. As sometimes an example is more useful
than a truckload of documentation, we've included a few configuration
files (see examples/*.cfg).</p>
<p>In this mode of operation (triggered by the "-e" switch), the
program will need a keyfile; this is the so-called "shared secret" or
"authentication string". The program uses the string in the keyfile to
calculate the CMTS MIC. This string has to be configured on the CMTS as
well, otherwise the cable modem will not be able to register.</p>
<p>An example key is provided in file examples/keyfile. The key is only
a string of characters. Any trailing newline (\n) or carriage return
(\r) characters are chopped to avoid confusion.</p>
<h2>Encoding PacketCable MTA configuration files</h2>
<p>To encode a CM configuration file, run:<br />
<code>$ docsis -p mta_config_file.cfg mta_config_file.bin</code></p>
<p>PacketCable MTA config files MUST start with the "MtaConfigDelimiter
1" configuration setting and MUST end with "MtaConfigDelimiter 255".
All other configuration settings must be either SnmpMibObject or
VendorSpecific. The program does not enforce this policy so you must
make sure you abide by it or the MTA will reject the file.</p>
<h2>Decoding CM or MTA binary configuration files</h2>
<p>To decode a binary file, run:<br />
<code>$ docsis -d my_binary_file.bin</code></p>
<h1>Adding new configuration settings</h1>
<p>To add new configuration settings, in most cases the only thing you
need to do is add them to the docsis_symtable.h (make sure you select
the correct type-functions for encoding and decoding).</p>
<p>Because of the way the encoder works, the symbol_name must determine
all other values in the table with the exception of id and parent. Thus
if two symbols share the same name they must also share the same
docsis_code, type-functions, limits etc. Only the id and parent can be
different.</p>
