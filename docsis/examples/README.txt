These examples are here only to show the syntax and for regression testing.
They are probably not useful in a real network; some use intentionally 'bad'
values for various parameters to stress test the encoder.

The *.cfg files are hand-written configuration examples.  The *.txt files are
the result of running the *.cfg files through docsis.  They exist for
regression testing purposes.

The test*cvc.der files are simply random data.  They are not real (or even
well-formed) CVCs.

The regression test script will fail if the MIBs are not installed.
